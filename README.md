gcloud-learn
============

This is my personal repository for practising Google Cloud configuration management automation.

Setup
-----

This downloads and installs a local SDK with gcloud command inside project directory:

    ./setup.sh

Use
---

Activate local setup:

    . activate

Deactivate local setup:

    . deactivate

Activation will create and deactivate will remove a gcloud configuration named after project directory.
